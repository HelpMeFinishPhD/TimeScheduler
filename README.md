# TimeScheduler 
A simple scheduler GUI to track how much time we spent (waste) on stuffs (most probably unimportant, actually). 

##A brief (his)story

Have you ever wondered where has all the time has gone? 
You came to the office in the morning, and suddenly after checking some (unimportant) emails, it is already lunchtime.
Then, in the afternoon you go and align some lasers, and very quickly it is dinnertime.
WHERE HAS ALL THE TIME GONE? WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING ALL DAY?

This simple app will let you track how much time you spend on stuffs, so you won't overspend (and sacrifice) on some (unimportant) stuffs. Simply start the session in the app before doing some stuff, and stop the session after you finish the stuff. The app will monitor how many hours you spend on some predefined stuffs in that particular week, and hopefully you can be more efficient next time.

This project was inspired by a friend of mine who often goes in some kind of time black hole. He probably needs something to reminds him if he sacrifices too much time on something with minimal benefit. 

##How to use and run the app

First, check whether you are using any Linux distros. If not, then goodluck.

Second, check whether you have installed Python (version 2.7) and PyQt4. If not, then google.

Hint: minimal editing are required to run the program in Windows or Mac, python3 or other version of PyQt.

The program can be simply run by typing in the terminal:
```
python run.py 
```
If you want to make the program executable, write in the terminal:
```
chmod +x run.py
```
In principle, you can also write a bash script to run the program from say, desktop.
